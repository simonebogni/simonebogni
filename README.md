### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simone and I'm a Full Stack developer and Tech Leader.
I specialize in Web and E-Commerce (Shopify) development.

I am an eager learner and I always strive to increase my knowledge, not only professionally.

Some of my interests include playing with RPG/TableTop games and cooking and experimenting with food (but mostly eating it ðŸ˜‰).
