### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Simone (pron: /sÉªmÉ”nÉ›/), nice to meet you!

#### ðŸ’» Technical and work details
I'm a **Full Stack developer** and **Tech Leader** for a group of 10 developers.\
I specialize in Web and **E-Commerce (Shopify Plus) development** and **solution planning**.\
I focus mostly on the **Laravel environment** (a PHP framework), but I'm familiar with other frameworks and programming languages too.\
When it comes to Shopify, I'm proficient both in building Storefront themes using Liquid (Shopify's templating language) as well as building fullstack applications and extensions to leverage Shopify's platform, as well as extending it.\
I'm currently working at an amazing **Shopify Plus partner agency**, with a very close multi-year collaboration with a famous multinational company.\
In terms of people I like to work with, I connect best with those that foster a spirit of diversity, inclusion and multiculturalism.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...
I am an eager learner and I always strive to increase my knowledge.\
I'm currently invested in learning better techniques to make the code more manageable and testable.

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
an interesting Laravel project in my spare time

#### âš¡ Fun facts
Some of my interests include playing with RPG/TableTop games and cooking and experimenting with food (but mostly eating it ðŸ˜‰).\
I'm a big fan of Marvel comics and movies, and my favourite book genre is fantasy!
